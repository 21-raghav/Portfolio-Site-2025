        As a React frontend developer, I’m passionate about creating clean,
        efficient, and user-friendly interfaces. While I’m still learning, I
        have a solid grasp of React basics, including components, state
        management, and API integration. I openly acknowledge that I’m working
        on improving my understanding of advanced React patterns and performance
        optimization. However, I am eager to collaborate, adapt, and grow as I
        refine my skills. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects while
        continuously learning from experienced developers and real-world
        challenges.
